VITE BUNNY: A DECENTRALIZED NFT MARKETPLACE ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN

ABSTRACT

This research paper explores the development, implementation, and evaluation of "Vite Bunny," a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform facilitates the creation, listing, purchase, and trading of digital collectibles through smart contracts while providing a user-friendly interface. This paper examines the technical architecture, design decisions, implementation challenges, and performance evaluations of the platform, with a focus on blockchain integration, frontend performance optimization, and security considerations.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background and Motivation

The NFT market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with digital artists, collectors, and investors embracing blockchain technology for verifying ownership and provenance of digital assets. However, existing marketplaces often present technical barriers to entry for new users or suffer from performance issues. Vite Bunny addresses these challenges by providing an intuitive user interface with robust blockchain functionality.

This research contributes to the field of decentralized applications by:
- Introducing a novel architecture that combines Next.js, MongoDB, and Ethereum smart contracts
- Presenting optimization techniques for improved load times and reduced gas costs
- Proposing a real-time synchronization mechanism between blockchain events and database records
- Providing empirical evidence of the platform's performance in production environments

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

3.1 Overview

Vite Bunny employs a hybrid architecture that combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain storage and processing:

- Frontend: Next.js-based React application with server-side rendering capabilities
- Smart Contracts: Solidity contracts deployed on Ethereum for NFT minting and marketplace operations
- Backend: API routes and serverless functions for handling data processing and integration
- Database: MongoDB for storing metadata, user information, and marketplace activity
- External Services: Alchemy for blockchain node access, IPFS for decentralized storage

3.2 Technology Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS, RainbowKit, wagmi
- Smart Contracts: Solidity 0.8.20, Hardhat, Ethers.js
- Backend: Next.js API routes, MongoDB
- Infrastructure: Vercel for hosting, MongoDB Atlas for database
- Testing: Jest, Hardhat testing framework

4. SMART CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 Contract Structure

The marketplace utilizes two primary smart contracts:

1. ViteBunnyNFT: An ERC-721 compatible contract for NFT minting and management
2. ViteBunnyMarketplace: A contract handling listings, sales, and transfers of NFTs

4.2 Key Functions

ViteBunnyNFT:
- mintNFT(address recipient, string tokenURI, string collection): Creates a new NFT
- getTokenCreator(uint256 tokenId): Returns the original creator of an NFT
- getTokenCollection(uint256 tokenId): Returns the collection name for an NFT

ViteBunnyMarketplace:
- createMarketItem(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, uint256 price): Lists an NFT for sale
- createMarketSale(uint256 itemId): Purchases an NFT
- cancelMarketItem(uint256 itemId): Removes an NFT from sale
- fetchMarketItems(): Retrieves all active listings
- fetchMyNFTs(): Retrieves NFTs owned by the caller
- fetchMyCreatedItems(): Retrieves NFTs created by the caller

4.3 Event Handling

The contracts emit events for key state changes:
- NFTMinted: Triggered when a new NFT is created
- MarketItemCreated: Triggered when an NFT is listed for sale
- MarketItemSold: Triggered when an NFT is purchased

4.4 Gas Optimization Techniques

- Strategic use of memory vs. storage variables
- Efficient data structures to minimize gas consumption
- Batch operations where applicable
- Optimized event parameter indexing

5. FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 Component Architecture

The frontend employs a modular component architecture:
- Reusable UI components (Button, NFTCard, CollectionCard)
- Page-specific components
- Context providers for state management
- Custom hooks for blockchain interactions

5.2 Blockchain Integration

- Integration with wallet providers via RainbowKit
- Transaction handling with error management
- Real-time contract event listening
- Optimistic UI updates for pending transactions

5.3 Performance Optimization

- Server-side rendering for improved initial load time
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting for reduced bundle size
- Skeleton loading states for enhanced perceived performance
- Eager connection to blockchain providers

5.4 User Experience Considerations

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clear transaction status indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Progressive enhancement based on wallet connectivity
