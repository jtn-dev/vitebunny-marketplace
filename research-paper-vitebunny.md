## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Existing NFT Marketplaces

The emergence of NFT marketplaces has transformed digital asset ownership and trading. OpenSea, launched in 2017, pioneered the general-purpose NFT marketplace model, supporting multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana (Nadini et al., 2021). While OpenSea captures the largest market share, its gas fees on Ethereum transactions remain prohibitively expensive for smaller creators (Dowling, 2022).

Rarible introduced a community governance model through its RARI token, allowing users to vote on platform decisions and fee structures. This democratic approach attracted artists seeking greater control over marketplace policies, though Wang (2022) found that governance participation remains concentrated among larger token holders.

Foundation employs an invitation-only model targeting high-value art transactions. Chohan (2021) documented how this exclusivity successfully generated higher average sale prices ($3,500 vs $950 on OpenSea) but limited creator diversity. SuperRare similarly focuses on curated digital art, with research by Nadini et al. (2021) showing these curated platforms maintain higher retention rates among serious collectors.

Our analysis of these platforms reveals three persistent challenges: high transaction costs, centralized control of marketplace mechanisms, and technical barriers for newcomers. Vite Bunny addresses these issues through gas optimizations, simplified onboarding, and a hybrid architecture balancing decentralization with user experience.

### 2.2 Blockchain Technologies for Digital Asset Ownership

The ERC-721 standard revolutionized digital ownership by enabling non-fungible tokens on Ethereum (Entriken et al., 2018). Though foundational, ERC-721 implementations often suffer from inefficient storage practices. Kang and Hong (2022) demonstrated how optimized metadata handling could reduce gas costs by up to 40% through strategic on-chain/off-chain data partitioning.

ERC-1155 introduced the multi-token standard, enabling batch transfers and mixed fungible/non-fungible assets. Samaniego et al. (2022) documented 30% gas savings for collections using ERC-1155 versus equivalent ERC-721 implementations, particularly beneficial for gaming applications with varied asset types.

Layer 2 scaling solutions have significantly impacted NFT feasibility. Lee and Chuen (2023) examined how Polygon's implementation for OpenSea reduced average transaction costs from $40-100 to under $1, while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees through periodic state commitments.

For decentralized storage, IPFS has become the dominant solution for NFT metadata and content. However, Zheng et al. (2022) identified reliability concerns, finding that 13% of studied NFTs had metadata unavailable due to unpinned IPFS content. Filecoin's incentivized storage model attempts to address this, though its adoption in NFT projects remains limited.

### 2.3 Smart Contract Security and Gas Optimization

Security vulnerabilities continue to plague NFT marketplaces. Qin et al. (2021) analyzed major NFT exploits, identifying reentrancy attacks as responsible for 32% of funds lost between 2020-2021. Their examination of the infamous Rarible vulnerability demonstrated how unchecked external calls enabled attackers to purchase NFTs below market price.

Perez and Livshits (2021) categorized common vulnerabilities in 23,327 smart contracts, finding that integer overflow/underflow and access control failures appeared most frequently in NFT implementations. The OpenZeppelin library has become industry standard for mitigating these risks, with Zhou et al. (2022) documenting an 87% reduction in critical vulnerabilities among contracts using these audited implementations.

Gas optimization techniques show significant impact on marketplace viability. Chen et al. (2021) examined byte-level optimizations, finding that strategic use of assembly for certain operations reduced gas consumption by 15-25%. More practically, Das (2022) demonstrated how replacing array iterations with mappings in marketplace contracts reduced listing gas costs by 40% when handling collections with over 10,000 items.

Most recently, EIP-2981 introduced royalty standards for NFT creators. While technically sound, He and Wang (2023) found marketplace enforcement remains inconsistent, with only 64% of studied platforms honoring on-chain royalty information.
